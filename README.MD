## Tests
The main test was connections through mysql. I tried multiple attempts at allowing the user to repeat inputs through one connection but ultimatly failed to allow the user to do this because of multiple connection bugs. This resulted in the user having to run the npm run start script every time they wanted to make another selection, this is definitly the big issue I need to iron out in the future.
